This crawler was built based on a library called beautifulsoup, this library is widely use for scrapping websites, It's one of the most user friendly library  out there, you can easily get started with it. for more functionality this library needs a module called "requests" to handle the http side of the project

For more information about beautifulsoup visit :

This specific webcralwer is synced for crawler the "roamnvm" website, this website is actully a blog which it posts are commonly about programming and tech news

It will crawl over the first page of this website and gather the title, summary and link of the post and save them in a csv file by default.

It's csv file is written by me, I dont know if the library it self support a method or something to help the programmer save the downloaded file easily or not.

By running the project as a script it will print it's findings on the terminal too.
