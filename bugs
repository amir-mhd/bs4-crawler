1 -- when running the script it dont recognize the lxml parser
[  raise FeatureNotFound(
bs4.FeatureNotFound: Couldn't find a tree builder with the features you requested: ]

solution ==> I find out it was because of my html parser, despite I installed lxml before everything 
but it didn't work! I changed my parser from "lxml" to "html.parser" and it worked fine!
